## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Traditional attendance systems suck:**
- **Manual roll call**: 5-10 mins wasted per class × 50 classes/day = **8+ hours lost weekly**
- **Biometric cards**: ₹5k-10k/student hardware, proxy marking common
- **Paper registers**: Lost data, manual errors, no analytics
- **No real-time monitoring**: Can't tell if classes are empty or teacher absent

**Our Solution**: Single IP camera detects/tracks students, recognizes faces, logs attendance automatically. Faculty see live dashboard with reports.
